The contents of this blog are not yet fully defined. It will likely be skewed toward technology, leadership, and the intersection of those. Simply because those topics are frequently on my mind. I'll also strive for a less is more approach, with short and crisp posts.

While the content of the blog remains to be seen, I do have a set of reasons as to why I want to try it out.

- **Getting into the flow.** I enjoy writing, thus having a blog is a venue for me to achieve flow.
- **Clearer thinking.** Writing is my preferred way to clarify my thoughts and reasoning. The process of formalizing ideas into text always leads to discovery of its own.
- **Building habits.** I'd like to create a habit of writing, and blog posts are easy to track and set goals around.
- **Personal development.** Sharing imperfect blog posts with the world is essentially cognitive behavioral therapy for a perfectionist like me.
- **Personal principle.** I believe we're all better off by being generous. Be that with time, love, money, anything. Or in this case, thoughts.

Writing is a journey, so let's see where this leads.
