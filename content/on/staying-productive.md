To improve productivity is to be able to create more value given the same input. It is how we achieve growth. I commonly ask variations of the question posed in the title of this article when I interview people for engineering positions. Software engineering is fast-paced knowledge work, and investing in personal productivity is an important lever.

Most answers I receive revolve around to-do lists and the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). As a self-improvement enthusiast and productivity hacker, I have also tried numerous frameworks for getting things done myself, and the structure they provide can surely be helpful. However, it took a long time for me to realize those techniques yield marginal impact. What worked for me was more fundamental.

This is how I stay productive:

- **Get enough sleep**. If you struggle with sleep like I used to, here are some [handy tips](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/matthew-walker-on-improving-sleep-quality).
- **Consume more healthy stuff** and less unhealthy stuff. Eat your veggies, drink your tea. [Reframe](https://www.reframeapp.com/) helped me drink more mindfully.
- **Take care of body and mind**. I exercise frequently, and I practice both mindfulness and gratitude daily.
- **Nurture relationships**. There is ample research on how essential relationships are to happiness, and I believe happy people are more productive in the long run. I actively make sure I check in with family, friends and colleagues, both former and current. Being around great people is one of the best things in life.
- **Routinely reflect and project**. I have established routines to regularly reflect on the past and project the future I want to see. Ordered by decreasing effort, I do this annually, quarterly, weekly and daily.
- **Optimize for [learning](/on/a-system-of-learning)**. Titles, salary or any other kinds of [miswantings](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/14549983/Miswanting.pdf;sequence=1) will bring you neither happiness nor productivity.

A rather mundane answer, but focusing on the basics has had a significant impact on my productivity. Coincidentally (not really), also on my wellbeing.
