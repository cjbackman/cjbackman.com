The pursuit of learning has been an [intrinsic value](https://programs.clearerthinking.org/intrinsic_values_test.html) to me for as long as I can remember. The driving force behind many, perhaps most, of my decisions in life has been curiosity and hunger to understand. I invest a significant amount of time into this quest of attaining knowledge and wisdom, and I find myself frequently viewing life through a lense of learning. Interactions, introspections, travels, the ups and owns, are all opportunities to learn. While I sometimes learn for a specific purpose, more commonly I do it for the joy of discovering.

In this article I want to share my system of learning. A simple approach to find knowledge, store insights and extract value, along multiple resources to check out and the tools I use.

## Find knowledge

The first step to learning is to find knowledge. Lucklily, that is easy today.

I am immensely grateful to all who invest their time and effort into sharing their knowledge with the world. Providing opportunities for others to learn and grow. The amount of information easily available thanks to the Internet and its contributors is staggering, and a treasure and privelege. Infinite wisdom, at the tip of your fingers.

My four main sources of finding knowledges are newsletters, podcasts, books, courses and the community. Some of my favorite and podcasts, at the time of writing, are listed below.

Additionally, I listen to a bunch of Swedish speaking podcasts, mainly about politics.

### Books

I enjoy reading and I consume both fiction and non-fiction. There are learnings in both. In this fast-paced and attention seeking time of ours, I find that books to be an important vehicle to train our attention and to trigger deeper thinking. There was a time when temporarily fell off the book reading wagon, and over time I realized how a resistance against reading longer texts started to build up. Once I got back into my habit of reading again, this resistence quickly subsided.

I have also tried tools like Blinkist, and while books can often be unnecessarily wordy, I much prefer them over any summary. Too much context is lost when a book is reduced into its core concepts and the complete lack of storytelling makes it difficult for any knowledge to stick.

### Courses

I loved my time in school and doing courses is still a way of learning I enjoy. It is not something I do regularly these days, but every now and then I treat myself to something on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) or [Clearer Thinking](https://www.clearerthinking.org/).

### Communities

This is the key source of my learning. Human interaction is most effective and pleasurable path to accelarate one's learning. Nothing beats discussing with colleagues, friends or in an online community (I like [Rands Leadership Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)).
